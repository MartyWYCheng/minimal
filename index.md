# About me

Hello! My name is Wen-Yu Cheng, but everyone calls me Marty! I've been passionate about creating things from a young age and have proven to be a resourceful researcher with large amounts of experience in <ins>**rapid prototyping**</ins>, <ins>**robotics**</ins>, and <ins>**prosthetics**</ins>. My passions also extend to communicating complex ideas in <ins>**academic/grant writing**</ins>, <ins>**public speaking**</ins>, and making <ins>**web content**</ins>. I've also had experience leading numerous project groups that have been rewarded with awards and extra funding. Helping people understand and solving tough problems makes me happier than anything else! I am currently in the final stages of my PhD program in Computer Science, and I'm highly interested in <ins>**AI**</ins> and <ins>**data analytics**</ins> applications in Human-Robot Interaction **<ins>(HRI)</ins>** and Human-Computer Interaction **<ins>(HCI)</ins>**.

# Education

Through the dual-enrollment program at FAU High, I entered college at age 15 and was able to accelerate my academic career. I started as a Mechanical Engineering major due to my interests in design and fabrication throughout all my life. While this interest never faded, I slowly realized that there was a growing need for more intelligent control of these complex systems that we create. So upon receiving my Bachelor's degree, I decided to change course and pursue a Master's degree in AI to attempt to unlock the full potential of mechanical systems with highly intelligent controls. I have now fallen in love with computer science and am always looking for new ways to use what I've learned to fulfill my desire to make life-changing creations for all. 

**Florida Atlantic University**
- BS in Mechanical Engineering with a Minor in Computer Science
  - Part of the Innovation Leadership Honors Program (ILHP)
- MS in Artificial Intelligence
- Pursuing a PhD in Computer Science
