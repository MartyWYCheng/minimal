# Experience

## Research Assistant
08/2018 – Present  
**Florida Atlantic University, BioRobotics Lab, Dr. Erik Engeberg**  
Boca Raton, FL

- Designed and built a novel high-density Force Myogram (FMG) sensor array capable of 100% classification accuracy across 20 hand gestures using AI.
- Developed a Soft Robotic Haptic Feedback Socket and was awarded $1,700 in total to advance the project from two separate grants in 2018 and 2019.
- Spearheaded a team that pioneered a Variable-Pressure Prosthetic Socket using Granular Jamming technology and was awarded $1,200 to advance the project in 2021.
- Created a 3D scanning system that increased scanning accuracy and success rate by 40%.

## Research Assistant
08/2018 – Present  
**Florida Atlantic University, Dr. Zhen Ni**  
Boca Raton, FL

- Developed a low-cost and reliable Wireless Charging Station for the TurtleBot 3 mobile robot platform.
- Integrated and optimized a PPO robotic arm training algorithm for the Kinova Gen 3 Robot Arm.

## Research Intern
06/2020 – 02/2024  
**Johns Hopkins University, Dr. Nitish Thakor**  
Baltimore, MD

- Designed a novel biomimetic Soft-Rigid Hybrid Prosthetic Finger capable of outputting more than 3 times the grasping force and nearly 2 times the angle of flexion with just 1/4th of the input pressure when compared to traditional soft robotic prosthetic fingers.
